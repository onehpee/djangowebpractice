Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean pragmatic design.
A Web framework is a set of components that provide a standard way to develop websites fast and easily.

Django’s primary goal is to ease the creation of complex database-driven websites.
Some well known sites that use Django include PBS, Instagram, Disqus, Washington Times, Bitbucket and Mozilla.



The second reason you should learn Django is the scope of its features. If you need to build a website, you don’t need to rely on any external libraries or packages if you choose Django. 
This means that you don’t need to learn how to use anything else, and the syntax is seamless as you’re using only one framework.

There’s also the added benefit that you don’t need to worry that updating one library or framework will render others that you’ve installed useless. 
If you do find yourself needing to add extra features, there are a range of external libraries that you can use to enhance your site.
